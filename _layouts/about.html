        <p class="lead">At Still Willows, we believe teams thrive when they feel grounded, supported, and emotionally steady.</p>

        <h2>Meet Rizqa</h2>
        <p>I'm Rizqa Armien, the mental wellness coach behind Still Willows. With a background in Occupational Therapy, Public Health, and online counselling, I've spent years helping people manage stress, rebuild healthy routines, and improve their emotional wellbeing.</p>

        <p>I created Still Willows because I saw a gap: most small teams care deeply about their people, but don't have access to affordable, personalised wellbeing support. Corporate wellness programs often feel impersonal — apps, webinars, and hotlines that employees rarely use.</p>

        <p>I wanted to offer something different: human-first support that feels genuine, accessible, and actually makes a difference in people's daily lives.</p>

        <p>Now, through Still Willows, I support small teams who want to prioritise mental wellness in a way that's simple, sustainable, and grounded in real connection.</p>
