        Is this therapy?

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>No. Still Willows provides mental wellness coaching, which focuses on stress management, emotional regulation, resilience, and healthy habit building. This is not clinical therapy or psychological treatment.</p>
          <p>If an employee requires clinical mental health care, such as treatment for depression, anxiety disorders, trauma, or other mental health conditions, they will be guided toward appropriate professional services.</p>

          <p>Traditional Employee Assistance Programmes often have very low utilisation rates, sometimes as low as three to five percent. They typically offer limited sessions, impersonal hotlines, and reactive crisis support.</p>
          <p>Still Willows offers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ongoing, high touch coaching rather than once off crisis support</li>
            <li>Real human connection with the same coach over time</li>
            <li>Flexible support that employees actually engage with</li>
            <li>Proactive wellbeing support rather than purely reactive intervention</li>
            <li>Regular engagement focused on everyday stress and sustainability</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Rizqa Armien-Yang brings a combination of clinical, operational, and public health experience to this work:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>BSc in Occupational Therapy</li>
            <li>Master's in Public Health (MPH)</li>
            <li>Management of a COVID 19 isolation centre in Cape Town during the pandemic</li>
            <li>Frontline clinical experience at a community clinic during COVID 19</li>
            <li>Experience working within a psychiatric hospital</li>
            <li>Online counselling experience</li>
            <li>Postgraduate training in Positive Psychology</li>
            <li>Trauma aware and culturally sensitive practice</li>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Yes. Still Willows was designed with distributed and remote first teams in mind. All coaching sessions, workshops, and support are delivered virtually, allowing team members to access support regardless of location.</p>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Yes. Many organisations begin with a smaller level of support to assess engagement and impact. Services are flexible and can scale as your team grows or as needs change.</p>
          <p>There is no long term commitment required. Support can be adjusted as you go.</p>

            <li>Managing stress at work</li>

        Is employee information kept confidential?
        <span class="faq-icon"></span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Yes. Everything shared in coaching sessions is private and confidential. Managers and HR do not receive information about who is using the service or what is discussed.</p>
          <p>Leadership receives only high level, anonymised themes such as common stressors or recurring challenges. This allows organisations to make informed decisions without compromising individual privacy.</p>

        How do employees book sessions?
        <span class="faq-icon"></span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Once an organisation is onboarded, employees receive an email containing a booking link. This allows them to schedule sessions directly with the coach at times that suit them.</p>
          <p>The booking process is simple, private, and self service. Employees do not need to go through HR or management to access support.</p>

          <p>Yes. While Still Willows primarily partners with organisations, individual coaching is also available for people seeking personal support outside of a workplace arrangement.</p>
          <p>Individual coaching can support stress management, finding balance, rebuilding routines, navigating transitions, emotional wellbeing, and sustainable habit building.</p>
