        Is this therapy?

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>No. Still Willows provides mental wellness coaching, which is focused on stress management, resilience, and healthy habit-building. This is not clinical therapy or counselling.</p>
          <p>If an employee needs clinical support — such as treatment for depression, anxiety disorders, trauma, or other mental health conditions — we'll help guide them toward appropriate professional resources.</p>

        How is this different from an EAP?

        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Traditional Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) often have low utilisation rates — sometimes as low as 3-5%. They typically offer limited sessions, impersonal hotlines, and reactive crisis support.</p>
          <p>Still Willows offers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>High-touch, ongoing coaching — not just crisis intervention</li>
            <li>Real human connection with the same coach</li>
            <li>Flexible support that employees actually use</li>
            <li>Proactive wellness, not just reactive help</li>
            <li>Regular engagement with your team's wellbeing</li>

        Can my fully remote team use this?

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Absolutely. Still Willows was designed with distributed and remote-first teams in mind. All coaching sessions, workshops, and support happen virtually — so your team members can access care no matter where they're located.</p>

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Yes. Many teams start with the Starter package to see how their employees respond to the support. Plans are flexible and can scale up as your team grows or as demand increases.</p>
          <p>There's no long-term commitment required — we can adjust as we go.</p>

          <p>Team workshops are short, practical group sessions (typically 45–60 minutes) that give everyone actionable strategies they can use right away. Topics include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Managing stress at work</li>
            <li>Building resilience</li>

        Is employee information kept confidential?

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Completely. What employees share in coaching sessions is private and confidential. Managers and HR never receive information about who is using the service or what they discuss.</p>
          <p>Leadership only receives high-level, anonymised themes — like "several employees mentioned workload stress" — so they can make informed decisions without breaching anyone's privacy.</p>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Once your company is set up, each employee receives a private booking link. They can schedule sessions directly at times that work for them — no need to go through HR or management.</p>
          <p>The booking process is simple, private, and completely self-service.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>Yes. While Still Willows primarily supports teams, I also work 1:1 with individuals who want personal support around stress, balance, routines, transitions, or emotional wellbeing.</p>
          <p>If you're looking for personal coaching (not through a company), you're welcome to book a consultation to discuss your needs.</p>
