        <p>Whether you are part of a team looking to support employee wellness, or an individual navigating the challenges of modern work and life, I hope you will find something useful here.</p>
        <p>Topics I plan to explore include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Managing stress in demanding environments</li>
          <li>Building resilience without burning out</li>
          <li>Creating healthy boundaries at work</li>
          <li>Navigating change and uncertainty</li>
          <li>Simple habits that make a real difference</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I believe that small, consistent steps lead to meaningful change. My goal is to share accessible, evidence-informed approaches that you can actually apply in your daily life.</p>
