Personal information is stored securely using reputable third-party service providers, including email, scheduling, and video-conferencing platforms.

We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, alteration, or disclosure. While we take appropriate steps to safeguard data, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
